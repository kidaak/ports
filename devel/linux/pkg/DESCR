Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system.

Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch
by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers
across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification
compliance.

It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged
Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries,
demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory
management, and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.
