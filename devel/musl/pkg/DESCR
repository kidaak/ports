Musl, pronounced like mussel or muscle, is an implementation of the
C/POSIX standard library intended for use on Linux-based systems,
licensed under a standard MIT license. Whereas the kernel (Linux)
governs access to hardware, memory, filesystems, and the privileges
for accessing these resources, the C library is responsible for
providing the actual C function interfaces userspace applications see,
and for constructing higher-level buffered stdio, memory allocation
management, thread creation and synchronization operations, and so
on using the lower-level interfaces the kernel provides, as well as
for implementing pure library routines of the C language like strstr,
snprintf, strtol, exp, sqrt, etc.
