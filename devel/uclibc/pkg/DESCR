uClibc is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems. It is much
smaller than the GNU C Library, but nearly all applications supported
by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc. uClibc even supports shared
libraries and threading. It currently runs on standard Linux and
MMU-less systems with support for alpha, amd64, ARM, Blackfin, cris,
h8300, hppa, i386, i960, ia64, m68k, mips/mipsel, PowerPC, SH, SPARC,
and v850 processors.
