The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.

Previously these utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU
utilities, Fileutils, Shellutils, and Textutils. Those three have been
combined into a single set of utilities called Coreutils.
