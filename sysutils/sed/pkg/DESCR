sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic
text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a
pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits
scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over
the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed's
ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes
it from other types of editors.
