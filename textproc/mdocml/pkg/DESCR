mdocml is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro package
of choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical
package for UNIX manuals. The mission of mdocml is to deprecate
groff, the GNU troff implementation, for displaying mdoc pages whilst
providing token support for man.
